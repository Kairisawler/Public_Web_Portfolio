		<h3></h3>
		<p>First and foremost, I'm a composer, programmer, web developer and a nerd! While my introduction on the home page may have given you an idea of who I am, it doesn't do much to explain who I am as a person, because that's what I am; a person! I've been working as a composer since early 2011; professionally from early 2013. Web Development (such as this site!) and Programming came much later, as I began that journey in the summer of 2017, when my application to the Nova Scotia Community College was accepted!</p>

		<h3>As a Composer...</h3>
		<p>Music has been a major part of my life, both daily and in general, for a very long time. When I was young I loved singing and whistling, and eventually I began piano lessons in my early teens. While piano lessons didn't last more than a couple years, music stuck with me as a need, rather than a want. I joined school bands from grade 6 onwards, choir for a number of years, and eventually found my love for composing in high school as part of an assignment in my music classes.</p>
		<p>It began with piano, eventually going on to be small electronic pieces, designed for small JRPGs through the RPG-Maker community. As I worked in that community, small commissions here and there, eventually Degica (the company who created RPG-Maker) commissioned me for a music pack. Thanks to the success of that small music pack, I went on to create four additional packs for them and truly began my career as a professional composer.</p>
		<p>While I continued to work on commissions, small indie-games and my own personal projects, I was eventually shown games by <em>Paradox Interactive Studios AB</em>, mainly <em><strong>Europa Universalis IV</strong></em>; a 'world conquest' style game, based in the mid 1400s to the early 1800s. I fell in love with the game, and eventually created a small music mod for the game, adding my own original music I created specifically for the game! As the mod grew and became popular, the lead developer for the game at the time, who went by <em>Wiz</em>, promoted my mod on their forums, and twitter; eventually getting in talks with me to commission me for a musical DLC for the game! It was also a great success, and lead to another two DLCs being commissioned in the following year (2016).</p>
		
		<h3>As a Programmer &#38; Web Developer...</h3>
		<p>Summer 2017, that's when this officially began. But it wasn't just a knee-jerk decision to delve into the IT Industry and learn to program and develop websites; no, this goes back to my childhood. My father runs a software development company, here in Nova Scotia, and when I was just starting out as a composer, he hired me, mostly so I'd have some steady income, at the company. Initially, I was a support tech, someone to answer support phone-calls and e-mails, assist with minor code testing for the other programmers, as well as general testing for the mobile-based apps. I began to pick up minor bits of html, javascript and the occational python as the months went by. By the time I left to focus on my own composing business, I had had my interest in software development and web development peaked!</p>
		
		<p>Finally, after working so long on video games for small and big developers alike, writing their music and creating the sound effects their games thrive on; I decided to make my own. I wanted to be able to have a project to work on in the slow months that I wouldn't need to prioritize during the busy months. The only problem was I didn't know how to code! Thus, my father suggested NSCC's IT Programming program, and I applied, was accepted, and eventually came to create this portfolio for. While this portfolio was originally just as a way to complete a project for a class, it's going to stick with me forever; constantly updated, improved upon and expanded.</p>
